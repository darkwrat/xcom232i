1. Sugar for coio_call with just open inside tarantool, to get rid of callbacks (+mr upstream).
2. A script for retrieving files (and possibly a fuse tarantoolfs that connects to the box and calls lua funcs).
3. Expose box_latch_lock with timeout to C api (+mr upstream).
4. Find a way to make coio_wait with multiple fds (timerfd) and use it for timeouts (+mr upstream).
5. Exclusively flock the serial port file.
6. Unhardcode device addresses and support multiple devices.
7. Enumerate object IDs somewhere with meaningful descriptions.
