Studer Innotec Serial Protocol command line tool
================================================

This archive file contains a command line tool to communicate
through the serial port with a RCC-02/03-32 remote control.

By this mean, it is possible to monitor and control an Xtender
System. This tool can be used for debug purpose, for scripting 
or by integrator that don't want to implement the protocol.

The protocol is open and fully documented. Please ask Studer Innotec
for the latest version of the specification.

If you received this tool by email, it could be named "scom._exe_" to avoid
issue with strict mail server virus policies. Please rename it to "scom.exe".

To get help about other commands of the command line tool:

>scom.exe help

or for a specific command:

>scom.exe [command] help


To check all serial ports from COM1 to COM20 and test possible connections:

>scom.exe test

Troubleshooting
---------------

After running scom.exe test, if the operating system detect a port but it's not possible
communicate with the RCC, you will see:

>COM1 opened with success
>  port not working with scom protocol: RESPONSE_TIMEOUT (3)

In this case, check if you are really using the right port. Serial port on the
motherboard are usually COM1 and COM2, USB-to-serial devices COM3 to COM9.

you can test the cable and PC hardware by connecting the pin 2 (RxD) with
the pin 3 (TxD) at the end of the cable. If it's working you will see for exemple:

COM6 opened with success
  port not working with scom protocol: INVALID_FRAME (1)
  
You should also be sure that you use a straight cable (no cross-wired, so called
null-modem, cable). With a multimeter check if there is a connection between
pin 2 (RxD), pin 3 (TxD) and pin 5 (GND) from one side to the other side.
